      <p>
        Here you find the second part of our tuning instructions
      </p>
			<h2>
			The big jump
			</h2>

			<p>
			Now if you've successfully tuned and ridden and also have experience with tuning, too much money and want to get a shaky hand on fast 2-wheels you're switching to a stronger setup.
			</p>

			<p>
			You have the option to choose a cylinder and carburetor combination that has a very strong resonance range, or even more torque.
			</p>

			<p>
			We already know the torque. The resonance range is the range around the speed of the maximum cylinder filling, i.e. the speed range for example from 8000-11000 by the exhaust very well the fresh gas back into the cylinder pushes and thus a very efficient combustion takes place.
			</p>

			<p>
			Again the choice is between 70 and 80 ccm or more ! more? Yes exactly, by a larger stroke for example is clearly more possible. We remember, the stroke is the distance between top and bottom dead center. With a 'higher' cylinder and a longer connecting rod (the thing where the piston is on the crankshaft) which should only be bought together with reinforced crankshafts (is one of them) more displacement is possible.
			</p>

			<p>
			If you want a lot of rpm, it is better to take a little less displacement because the weight of the moving parts (pistons) and the friction is lower. There is more torque with a larger displacement.
			</p>

			<p>
			Now what do you need ? Since you are now in the midrace segment, you can already make a list:
			</p>

			<section>

				<img src="img/21gaser.jpg">
				<ul>
					<li>cylinder</li>
					<li>crankshaft, crankshaft bearing</li>
					<li>24 mm carburettor (more consumption but also more power)</li>
					<li>intake system (diaphragm block and intake socket where the carburettor is located)</li>
					<li>Exhaust (the sport exhaust is no longer sufficient)</li>
					<li>Internal rotor ignition if required</li>
				</ul>

			</section>

			<p>
			An internal rotor ignition is on the one hand designed by the ignition unit for more power than the original ignition and on the other hand has a lower mass which has to be moved at the crankshaft. There are also differences. To adjust read this thread.
			</p>

			<p>
			As a cylinder I will give you some examples with matching exhaust systems:
			</p>

			<section>

				<img src="img/turbokit.jpg">
				<ul>
					<li>Airsal Racing 70 ccm + Yasuni R2/R3 / SCR Racing Line...</li>
					<li>Metrakit SP 70 ccm + Yasuni R2/R3 / SCR Racing Line...</li>
					<li>Athena Racing 70 ccm + Yasuni R2/R3 / SCR Racing Line...</li>
					<li>Airsal Racing 80 ccm + Turbokit Carrera 80...</li>
					<li>Barikit Alu Racing 80 ccm + Turbokit Carrera 80...</li>
					<li>Hebo Tomahawk 80 ccm + Turbokit Carrera 80...</li>
				</ul>

			</section>

			<p>
			please forget Malossi cylinder... the price is purchase disqualifying.
			</p>

			<p>
			As crankshaft the Barikit Competition with C4 crankshaft bearings is very good ! It can withstand a lot and is super processed. Crankshaft installation is below under ''The experience and the money are there? the performance is not enough for you? 20 PS + do you want?'' described.
			</p>

			<p>
			With the intake system there is a lot of talk and little fact, you can inform yourself there and choose a suitable intake manifold to the carburetor.
			</p>

			<p>
			The carburettor should be a flat slide on high speed setups, a round slide can score on high torque setups which do not turn very high.
			</p>

			<p>
			If you have now arrived here you have a strong setup with a good tuning and the right gear ratio of 120 kmh in it.
			</p>

			<p>
			The experience and the money are there? the performance is not enough for you? 20 PS + do you want?
			</p>

			<p>
			So now it should really bang, the neighbour cat should fall from the garage door in the morning when you start your way to school? you don't want to miss the hairdresser appointment that was yesterday noon?
