        <article class="main">
			<p>
			  Here the way from an original moped to a high-end vehicle is explained.
			</p>
			<h2>The beginning:</h2>

			<p>
			You get your moped new or used and drive the legal 45 km/h. However, you quickly notice that the moped is not exactly fast and your friends tell you ''unthrottle it and install a sports exhaust, the engine must breathe freely in and out !''. So you take your exhaust down and buy a sports exhaust which is legal thanks to its E-number. But in order to elicit performance from the exhaust you have to unthrottle it, i.e. remove the flow limiting discs which are welded into the manifold, for example. This will invalidate the operating permit of the exhaust!
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The sport exhaust uses the resonance principle, the exhaust gases come out of the cylinder, but since the overflow ducts and exhaust duct are open at the same time, the mixture tries to come out of the cylinder, at that moment (the ''moment'' is decided, therefore the sport exhaust must also fit the cylinder) part of the sound waves of the exhaust gases bounce off the counter-cone and push the escaping fresh gas back into the cylinder.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			If you want to remain inconspicuous, you remove the throttle from your original aspuffle. It doesn't have as much power as a sports exhaust, but it's much less conspicuous.
			</p>
			<p>
			Now you also remove the other throttles (neglect to throttle the exhaust, you have already removed them in the sport exhaust or original exhaust, which makes the E-number expire, but leads to more power).
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Since your moped now has enough power to pull a larger gear ratio, you can check here for an appropriate gear ratio. In the small questions thread you can ask if your moped can turn off the gear, imagine you have a bike with 27 gears and want to start in the highest gear !
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Before you drive off, check out which main jet you have to use to prevent your engine from getting lean (too much air on too little fuel) and getting one of the popular heaters engine damage.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Now that your moped is unthrottled and has a sport exhaust to make noise it makes about 85 Kmh.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			If you don't want the police to get their act together you can buy a speed limiter and save yourself a lot of trouble. Please don't get used to the horrible word black box, because we don't drive airplanes but mopeds !
			</p>
			
			<h2>
			More cubic capacity:
			</h2>
			
			<p>
			''Ey Oida do you also have a cubic set in Oida?'' What does your colleague mean?
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Exactly he means a cylinder with more cubic capacity ! Imagine the cylinder as a container, 50 ccm / 50 ml water would fit into your cylinder if you would fill it (no leave Mama's watering can, the cylinder doesn't stand that well). This is also the room where the combustion takes place. Purely geometrically the cubic capacity is calculated from the bore thus the diameter and the stroke thus the distance between highest and lowest dead center. This is the distance the piston travels from top to bottom.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Popular are cylinders that are drivable on the original crankshaft, so neither have too much torque, nor turn too high.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Torque is the force with which a rotating mass is brought to rotational speed.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Now you have the possibility to buy either a 70 ccm cylinder or one with 80 ccm. Also intermediate values are possible. 1 ring pistons belong to Racing/Midrace cylinders which should not necessarily be driven on the original crankshaft and 2 ring pistons belong to Sport cylinders.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			So you look for a cylinder with 70 ccm doer 80 ccm but of course pay attention to the engine block which you have installed in your moped. Decisive differences can be found between the AM6, D50B0 and the EBS engine. Please order only suitable.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Since the cylinder has more displacement, it can also use more mixture for the combustion, so you need a bigger carburetor whereby a 21 mm carburetor is sufficient.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Since the cylinder has a different cubic capacity, more exhaust gases and different exhaust speeds can be reconciled with an exhaust. The sport exhaust can be driven further because the cylinders are not yet very powerful and you want to drive everyday. A reinforced clutch is however necessary because the clutch plates are not pressed otherwise strongly enough and thus slip through. That means the clutch grinds as if you would pull the lever a little while driving and thus you have power loss!
			</p>
			<p>
			After you have tuned the carburettor with suitable nozzles and have chosen a larger ratio you create the 100er mark.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			If you are now satisfied you can be on the road like this... or you save money and then comes
			</p>
			
			<h2>
			The big jump
			</h2>
			
			<p>
			Now if you've successfully tuned and ridden and also have experience with tuning, too much money and want to get a shaky hand on fast 2-wheels you're switching to a stronger setup.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			You have the option to choose a cylinder and carburetor combination that has a very strong resonance range, or even more torque.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			We already know the torque. The resonance range is the range around the speed of the maximum cylinder filling, i.e. the speed range for example from 8000-11000 by the exhaust very well the fresh gas back into the cylinder pushes and thus a very efficient combustion takes place.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Again the choice is between 70 and 80 ccm or more ! more? Yes exactly, by a larger stroke for example is clearly more possible. We remember, the stroke is the distance between top and bottom dead center. With a 'higher' cylinder and a longer connecting rod (the thing where the piston is on the crankshaft) which should only be bought together with reinforced crankshafts (is one of them) more displacement is possible.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			If you want a lot of rpm, it is better to take a little less displacement because the weight of the moving parts (pistons) and the friction is lower. There is more torque with a larger displacement.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Now what do you need ? Since you are now in the midrace segment, you can already make a list:
			</p>

			<section>

				<img src="img/21gaser.jpg">
				<ul>
					<li>cylinder</li>
					<li>crankshaft, crankshaft bearing</li>
					<li>24 mm carburettor (more consumption but also more power)</li>
					<li>intake system (diaphragm block and intake socket where the carburettor is located)</li>
					<li>Exhaust (the sport exhaust is no longer sufficient)</li>
					<li>Internal rotor ignition if required</li>
				</ul>

			</section>
		
			<p>
			An internal rotor ignition is on the one hand designed by the ignition unit for more power than the original ignition and on the other hand has a lower mass which has to be moved at the crankshaft. There are also differences. To adjust read this thread.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			As a cylinder I will give you some examples with matching exhaust systems:
			</p>
			
			<section>

				<img src="img/turbokit.jpg">
				<ul>
					<li>Airsal Racing 70 ccm + Yasuni R2/R3 / SCR Racing Line...</li>
					<li>Metrakit SP 70 ccm + Yasuni R2/R3 / SCR Racing Line...</li>
					<li>Athena Racing 70 ccm + Yasuni R2/R3 / SCR Racing Line...</li>
					<li>Airsal Racing 80 ccm + Turbokit Carrera 80...</li>
					<li>Barikit Alu Racing 80 ccm + Turbokit Carrera 80...</li>
					<li>Hebo Tomahawk 80 ccm + Turbokit Carrera 80...</li>
				</ul>
				
			</section>
			
			<p>
			please forget Malossi cylinder... the price is purchase disqualifying.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			As crankshaft the Barikit Competition with C4 crankshaft bearings is very good ! It can withstand a lot and is super processed. Crankshaft installation is below under ''The experience and the money are there? the performance is not enough for you? 20 PS + do you want?'' described.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			With the intake system there is a lot of talk and little fact, you can inform yourself there and choose a suitable intake manifold to the carburetor.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The carburettor should be a flat slide on high speed setups, a round slide can score on high torque setups which do not turn very high.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			If you have now arrived here you have a strong setup with a good tuning and the right gear ratio of 120 kmh in it.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The experience and the money are there? the performance is not enough for you? 20 PS + do you want?
			</p>
			
			<p>
			So now it should really bang, the neighbour cat should fall from the garage door in the morning when you start your way to school? you don't want to miss the hairdresser appointment that was yesterday noon?
			</p>
			
			<h2>
			Then you need:
			</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>a cylinder with high timing, a high compression</li>
				<li>a carburetor where you can insert your bank card directly into the slot</li>
				<li>on EVERY CASE (I have no muhaha) an inner rotor or outer rotor tuning ignition</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
			But okay, you wanted it that way. First you have to do an engine overhaul and have a look what you're dealing with after the last orgies of rpm. If the transmission jams and grumbles when I shift gears, I would change the bearings. With the AM6 a Top shift roller obstruct there otherwise the next 3 metatarsal breaks show when you Moped drove, AM6 transmissions are not soo the racer and shifting can hurt with a strong cylinder.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			With the Derbi engines is a new gasket set and Simmerinsatz PFLICHT!
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Now first to the knowledge:
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The crankshaft rotates 360 ° with each revolution, the timing in ° indicates after how many ° revolution e.g. the upper edge of the outlet is reached again by the piston roof. This is described in more detail here and especially here. High control times cause a strong reso but a weak torque before the reso.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The compression is the pressure that is created when the piston has reached the top dead center and the mixture has compressed. A standard car compresses the mixture in a ratio of 10:1. The higher the compression, the higher the efficiency, but also the stronger the tendency to knock (mixture detonation). One can increase the compression by turning off the cylinder at the upper side, reduce by a thicker seal which also increases the SZ somewhat, so do not exaggerate!
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Now it starts ! Now it is ordered, from 50-87 or more ccm everything is possible. Usual are setups with 70, 80 or 85-87 ccm.
			</p>

			</section>
			
			<p>
			As a carburetor you can reach for a 28-32 mm. The intake system must of course fit again to the connection width of the carburettor.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			So where were we? The engine is disassembled in front of you, bearing and crankshaft frozen in the freezer. So get out with the hot air blower and warm up the bearing seats from some distance. After 10 minutes insert the bearings (they fall in) and knock a little with a rubber hammer so that they don't wedge. Just don't squeeze any dirt under the bearings !
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Now wait until the bearings have expanded again by returning to normal temperature and knock again a little. Now carefully warm the bearings a little bit and put the crankshaft into one half of the block. Make sure that the gearbox is ready for installation.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			If the gasket set is in between, the engine block halves can be put together again. Now mount the powertrain where you hopefully took pictures during the disassembly. Now install the cylinder correctly and adjust the squeeze gap between piston and cylinder head by different thick seals until it has about 0.65-0.9 mm. Now install and adjust the ignition and install the intake system. The carburettor MUST be adjusted to grease because now when the engine is installed and the exhaust is on it the tuning follows.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			If you do all this right and don't mess up, maybe you have installed a flow cooler and an electric water pump you can annoy your neighbour's cat !
			</p>
			
			<p>
			But be careful, the performance has multiplied and there are completely different demands on the driver. Furthermore, the fuel consumption is higher than with our neighbour's diesel generator from 1892.
