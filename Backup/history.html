                <h2>Motorcycle History</h2>
                <p>
                  The first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Daimler Reitwagen, it was designed
                  by the German inventor Gottlieb Daimeler and Wikhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt,in 1885.The early
                    Motorcycle did not use the principles of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics developed nearly 70 years earlier.
                  Instead,it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning.
                </p>
                <p>

                  The inventors called their invention the Reitwagen ("riding car"). It was designed as an expedient testbed
                  for their new engine, rather than a true prototype vehicle.It was firstly built by  Merryweather Fire Engine
                  company in Greenwich, in 1888.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first commercial design for a self-propelled cycle was a three-wheel design called the Butler Petrol Cycle,
                  conceived of Edward Butler in England in 1884
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a motorcycle.
                  in England the Excelsior Motor Company began producing Motorcikles in 1896.

                <p>

                  The Motorbikes had an great impact at Modern warfear, they weare used in sted of horse to comunicate behind the lines.

                <h3>Motorbikes in the 20st century</h3>
                <p>
                  In the 1950s, streamlining began to play an increasing part in the
                  development of racing motorcycles and the "dustbin fairing" held out
                  the possibility of radical changes to motorcycle design

                <h3>Motorcycles in modern days</h3>
                <p>
                  The technology is already so far that there are Electrically operated motorbikes available.
                  The only downside of Electrically operated motorbikes is that there Range is limited to 50 km.
                </p>
  
                <p>
                  In the 21st century, the motorcycle industry is mainly dominated by the Indian
                  motorcycle industry and by Japanese motorcycle companies.In addition to the large
                  capacity motorcycles, there is a large market in smaller capacity (less than 300 cc)
                  motorcycles, mostly concentrated in Asian and African countries and produced in China and India
