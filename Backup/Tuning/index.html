        <article class="main">
			<p>
        Here you find the first part of our tuning instructions
			</p>
			<h2>The beginning:</h2>

			<p>
			You get your moped new or used and drive the legal 45 km/h. However, you quickly notice that the moped is not exactly fast and your friends tell you ''unthrottle it and install a sports exhaust, the engine must breathe freely in and out !''. So you take your exhaust down and buy a sports exhaust which is legal thanks to its E-number. But in order to elicit performance from the exhaust you have to unthrottle it, i.e. remove the flow limiting discs which are welded into the manifold, for example. This will invalidate the operating permit of the exhaust!
			</p>

			<p>
			The sport exhaust uses the resonance principle, the exhaust gases come out of the cylinder, but since the overflow ducts and exhaust duct are open at the same time, the mixture tries to come out of the cylinder, at that moment (the ''moment'' is decided, therefore the sport exhaust must also fit the cylinder) part of the sound waves of the exhaust gases bounce off the counter-cone and push the escaping fresh gas back into the cylinder.
			</p>

			<p>
			If you want to remain inconspicuous, you remove the throttle from your original aspuffle. It doesn't have as much power as a sports exhaust, but it's much less conspicuous.
			</p>
			<p>
			Now you also remove the other throttles (neglect to throttle the exhaust, you have already removed them in the sport exhaust or original exhaust, which makes the E-number expire, but leads to more power).
			</p>

			<p>
			Since your moped now has enough power to pull a larger gear ratio, you can check here for an appropriate gear ratio. In the small questions thread you can ask if your moped can turn off the gear, imagine you have a bike with 27 gears and want to start in the highest gear !
			</p>

			<p>
			Before you drive off, check out which main jet you have to use to prevent your engine from getting lean (too much air on too little fuel) and getting one of the popular heaters engine damage.
			</p>

			<p>
			Now that your moped is unthrottled and has a sport exhaust to make noise it makes about 85 Kmh.
			</p>

			<p>
			If you don't want the police to get their act together you can buy a speed limiter and save yourself a lot of trouble. Please don't get used to the horrible word black box, because we don't drive airplanes but mopeds !
			</p>

			<h2>
			More cubic capacity:
			</h2>

			<p>
			''Ey Oida do you also have a cubic set in Oida?'' What does your colleague mean?
			</p>

			<p>
			Exactly he means a cylinder with more cubic capacity ! Imagine the cylinder as a container, 50 ccm / 50 ml water would fit into your cylinder if you would fill it (no leave Mama's watering can, the cylinder doesn't stand that well). This is also the room where the combustion takes place. Purely geometrically the cubic capacity is calculated from the bore thus the diameter and the stroke thus the distance between highest and lowest dead center. This is the distance the piston travels from top to bottom.
			</p>

			<p>
			Popular are cylinders that are drivable on the original crankshaft, so neither have too much torque, nor turn too high.
			</p>

			<p>
			Torque is the force with which a rotating mass is brought to rotational speed.
			</p>

			<p>
			Now you have the possibility to buy either a 70 ccm cylinder or one with 80 ccm. Also intermediate values are possible. 1 ring pistons belong to Racing/Midrace cylinders which should not necessarily be driven on the original crankshaft and 2 ring pistons belong to Sport cylinders.
			</p>

			<p>
			So you look for a cylinder with 70 ccm doer 80 ccm but of course pay attention to the engine block which you have installed in your moped. Decisive differences can be found between the AM6, D50B0 and the EBS engine. Please order only suitable.
			</p>

			<p>
			Since the cylinder has more displacement, it can also use more mixture for the combustion, so you need a bigger carburetor whereby a 21 mm carburetor is sufficient.
			</p>

			<p>
			Since the cylinder has a different cubic capacity, more exhaust gases and different exhaust speeds can be reconciled with an exhaust. The sport exhaust can be driven further because the cylinders are not yet very powerful and you want to drive everyday. A reinforced clutch is however necessary because the clutch plates are not pressed otherwise strongly enough and thus slip through. That means the clutch grinds as if you would pull the lever a little while driving and thus you have power loss!
			</p>
			<p>
			After you have tuned the carburettor with suitable nozzles and have chosen a larger ratio you create the 100er mark.
			</p>

			<p>
			If you are now satisfied you can be on the road like this... or you save money and then comes
