        Here you find the third part of our tuning instructions
			</p>

			<h2>
			Then you need:
			</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>a cylinder with high timing, a high compression</li>
				<li>a carburetor where you can insert your bank card directly into the slot</li>
				<li>on EVERY CASE (I have no muhaha) an inner rotor or outer rotor tuning ignition</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
			But okay, you wanted it that way. First you have to do an engine overhaul and have a look what you're dealing with after the last orgies of rpm. If the transmission jams and grumbles when I shift gears, I would change the bearings. With the AM6 a Top shift roller obstruct there otherwise the next 3 metatarsal breaks show when you Moped drove, AM6 transmissions are not soo the racer and shifting can hurt with a strong cylinder.
			</p>

			<p>
			With the Derbi engines is a new gasket set and Simmerinsatz PFLICHT!
			</p>

			<p>
			Now first to the knowledge:
			</p>

			<p>
			The crankshaft rotates 360 ° with each revolution, the timing in ° indicates after how many ° revolution e.g. the upper edge of the outlet is reached again by the piston roof. This is described in more detail here and especially here. High control times cause a strong reso but a weak torque before the reso.
			</p>

			<p>
			The compression is the pressure that is created when the piston has reached the top dead center and the mixture has compressed. A standard car compresses the mixture in a ratio of 10:1. The higher the compression, the higher the efficiency, but also the stronger the tendency to knock (mixture detonation). One can increase the compression by turning off the cylinder at the upper side, reduce by a thicker seal which also increases the SZ somewhat, so do not exaggerate!
			</p>

			<p>
			Now it starts ! Now it is ordered, from 50-87 or more ccm everything is possible. Usual are setups with 70, 80 or 85-87 ccm.
			</p>

			In addition there are different exhaust systems whose suitability should be actually clear:

			As a carburetor you can reach for a 28-32 mm. The intake system must of course fit again to the connection width of the carburettor.
			</p>

			<p>
			So where were we? The engine is disassembled in front of you, bearing and crankshaft frozen in the freezer. So get out with the hot air blower and warm up the bearing seats from some distance. After 10 minutes insert the bearings (they fall in) and knock a little with a rubber hammer so that they don't wedge. Just don't squeeze any dirt under the bearings !
			</p>

			<p>
			Now wait until the bearings have expanded again by returning to normal temperature and knock again a little. Now carefully warm the bearings a little bit and put the crankshaft into one half of the block. Make sure that the gearbox is ready for installation.
			</p>

			<p>
			If the gasket set is in between, the engine block halves can be put together again. Now mount the powertrain where you hopefully took pictures during the disassembly. Now install the cylinder correctly and adjust the squeeze gap between piston and cylinder head by different thick seals until it has about 0.65-0.9 mm. Now install and adjust the ignition and install the intake system. The carburettor MUST be adjusted to grease because now when the engine is installed and the exhaust is on it the tuning follows.
			</p>

			<p>
			If you do all this right and don't mess up, maybe you have installed a flow cooler and an electric water pump you can annoy your neighbour's cat !
			</p>

			<p>
			But be careful, the performance has multiplied and there are completely different demands on the driver. Furthermore, the fuel consumption is higher than with our neighbour's diesel generator from 1892.
